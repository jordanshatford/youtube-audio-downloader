# Development

## With Docker
To run the application for development purposes, you can use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) which utilizes the [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers written for both the frontend and backend.

You can run the application using the following command:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

## Without Docker
To run the application without [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) see the [Frontend](./FRONTEND.md) and [Backend](./BACKEND.md) documentation.
